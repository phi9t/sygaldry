# Local Skills

This repo contains **repo-scoped** skills under `skills/` for validation before global install.

## zephyr-container-exec (local only)

Paths:
- Skill root: `skills/zephyr-container-exec/`

- Scripts: `skills/zephyr-container-exec/scripts/`

Do not install into `$CODEX_HOME/skills` until validation is complete.
